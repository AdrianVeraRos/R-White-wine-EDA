## About
In this EDA we aim to analyze the white variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine with data from the book “Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties.” by P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis.
“Vinho verde” translates as “Young wine”, or wines that are relased 3-6 months after harvest.

The dataset is comprised by 4898 observations from 13 different variables, where we have the wines ordered by a numeric key, different objective physicochemical characteristics of each wine and the median of at least 3 subjective sensory evaluations made by wine experts. With this data, we aim to find what makes a great wine. 

More information about the nature of the variables can be found here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt

## File Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

white_wine_EDA.Rmd — main file containing the R code and the plot descriptions.
white_wine_EDA.html — knitted html file from the R code.
